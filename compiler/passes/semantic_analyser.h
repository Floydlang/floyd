/*
	Performs semantic analysis of a Floyd program.

	Converts an unchecked_ast_t to a semantic_ast_t.

	- All language-level syntax checks passed.
	- Builds symbol tables, resolves all symbols.
	- Checks types.
	- Infers types when not specified.
	- Replaces operations with other, equivalent operations.
	- has the unchecked_ast_t and symbol tables for all lexical scopes.
	- Inserts host functions.
	- Insert built-in types.

	- All nested blocks remain and have their own symbols and statements.

	Output is a program that is correct with no type/semantic errors.

	NOTICE: Intrinsics do not have function prototypes / entries in ast _function_defs.
