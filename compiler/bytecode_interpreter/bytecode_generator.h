/*
Compiles the ast to Floyd byte code, ready to interpret.

The result is a ready-to-run program that has a global scope (with symbols and instructions) a bunch of functions (with their own symbols and instructions), which types are use and some global config, like container settings.

The byte code scopes are flattened: they don't have sub-scopes. This is flattened out during code gen. All instructions and symbols of a function (or global scope) are in *one* long list.
